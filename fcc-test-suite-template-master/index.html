        <p>Blues is a music genre[3] and musical form which was originated in 
          the Deep South of the United States around the 1860s[2] by African-Americans 
          from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, and spirituals. </p><p>Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, 
          and rhymed simple narrative ballads </p>

        <p>
            The lyrics of early traditional blues verses probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called "AAB" pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars.[10] Two of the first published blues songs, "Dallas Blues" (1912) and "Saint Louis Blues" (1914), 
            were 12-bar blues with the AAB lyric structure.</p>

W.C. Handy wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times.[11]

        <p>The first publication of blues sheet music may have been "I Got the Blues", 
          published by New Orleans musician Antonio Maggio in 1908 and described as "the earliest 
          published composition known to link the condition of having the blues to the musical form that would become popularly known as 'the blues.'"[32] Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues" was published in 1912; W.C. Handy's "The Memphis Blues" followed in the same year. The first recording by an African American singer was Mamie Smith's 1920 rendition of Perry Bradford's "Crazy Blues". But the origins of the blues were some decades earlier, probably around 1890.[33] This music is poorly documented, partly because of racial discrimination in U.S. society, including academic circles,[34] and partly because of the low rate of literacy among rural African Americans at the time.

          City or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic.[75] Classic female urban and vaudeville blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them "the big three"â€”Gertrude "Ma" Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Lucille Bogan. Mamie Smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African American to record a blues song in 1920; her second record, "Crazy Blues", sold 75,000 copies in its first month.[76] Ma Rainey, the "Mother of Blues", and Bessie Smith each "[sang] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room". Smith would "sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry in bending and stretching notes with her beautiful, 
          powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed" </p>

        <p>Blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have 
          influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music. </p><p>
            [119] Prominent jazz, folk or rock performers, such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Bob Dylan have performed significant blues recordings. The blues scale is often used in popular songs like Harold Arlen's "Blues in the Night", blues ballads like "Since I Fell for You" and "Please Send Me Someone to Love", and even in orchestral works such as George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" and "Concerto in F". Gershwin's second "Prelude" for solo piano is an interesting example of a classical blues, maintaining the form with academic strictness. The blues scale is ubiquitous in modern popular music and informs many modal frames, especially the ladder of thirds used in rock music (for example, in "A Hard Day's Night"). Blues forms are used in the theme to the televised Batman,
