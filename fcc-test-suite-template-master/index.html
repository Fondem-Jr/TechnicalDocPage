          Learning to play guitar is fun, but where do you start? What kind of equipment is necessary? Luckily, once you have a guitar, you can pretty much get started, but just to be safe, here’s what you need to begin.

          Between acoustic and electric, pick the one you’re most interested in. Acoustics are great for traveling, as they don’t need amps to project.

          However, electric guitars have more fret room for squealing solos, and if you want to practice quietly, you can always unplug the amp

          Lighter or lower gauges (thinner strings) minimize the soreness in your hands as you start learning. For acoustics, try strings that start with .011 gauge and .010 for electric guitars.

          Chords help you build up your hand strength, and they are the building blocks of songs. Most songwriters start with just a chord progression, and you can easily learn many pop songs with just 3 simple guitar chords
